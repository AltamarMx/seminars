## To Code or to GPT ?
<br>
In the age of AI, as we stand on the cusp of remarkable technological advancements, it's imperative that we both program and utilize tools like GPT with a discerning eye. 
<br>
<br>
We must be critically aware of their capabilities, embrace their strengths, and cautiously navigate their limitations. Let's not be mere passive users; let's be conscious architects of our digital future, ensuring AI serves humanity's best interests.
